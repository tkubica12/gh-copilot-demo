- Use docstrings to document functionality. 
- Comments only for things that are not obvious, not based on comments of progress, just to explain non-obvious lines worth extra documentation.
- Prefer `simplicity` and readability
- As you implement code, update `docs/ImplementationLog.md` with your progress and technical and architecture decisions
- Document common errors and pitfalls you encountered and had to fix in `docs/CommonErrors.md`, but only after I have confirmed issues are resolved and you have a solution.
- When facing any issues, refer to `docs/CommonErrors.md` to see if you can find a solution. Search internet to gather more insights. 
- Continuously build short instructions how to run and test the project in `README.md` of particular service or component
- Avoid big files, split code if it makes sense
- Do not proactively write any helper scripts outside of application code (eg. deployment or configuration script), only if asked to do so. If you think some helper script is needed, ask first.
- To speed up troubleshooting you may write simple tests that leverage your main classes and methods to quickly verify functionality. Always store this in `tests/` folder, never in `src/` or main code. 
- If in doubts or before doing major decision that changes the architecture or design, ask me first.
- Main language for this project is `Python`. Use `uv` to manage Python virtual environments and packages. Always work with `pyproject.toml` (not requirements.txt) and run apps with `uv run` command.
- We use Azure so when giving cloud examples, use Azure solutions and CLI commands.
- For Infrastructure as Code we use Terraform in this project.
