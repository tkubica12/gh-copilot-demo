File `docs/ImplementationLog.md` contains implementation log that keeps track of all changes and progress made during implementation. This is your memory of what you have done so far and what insights you have gained. Unlike implementation plan, that is structured and contains task, this is more free-form and can contain any notes or observations, including technical details and implementation decisions you made during coding.

- Your task is to review the implementation log document and streamline it by removing any redundant or irrelevant entries, ensuring that it is concise and focused on key insights and decisions.
- Group similar entries together and provide a brief description for each group to enhance clarity and organization.
- Remove records that are no longer relevant or too detailed, keeping only those that provide valuable insights or document significant decisions.
- The goal is to make the implementation log easier to read and reference in the future, while retaining important information about the implementation process.
- Fully consolidate the document, ensuring that it is well-organized and free of unnecessary repetition or clutter.
